## 🌟 The Core Loop: Learn -> Earn -> Create

1.  **LEARN**: The child completes educational modules in the Curriculum.
2.  **EARN**: Success rewards the child with **Stars** ⭐ and **Items** 🎒.
3.  **CREATE**: Stars and Items are used to craft new toys, art, and stories.

## 🎒 Inventory (My Bag)

Where the child stores their hard-earned loot.
